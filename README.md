# PicoGrid with LoRa 2.4 GHz

This is a project I had done for my final year project on TUDublin for my BSc Honours Degree in Networking Applications & Services. If you plan to use my project, please don't ask me to update any of code as I am
providing them as is.

It is highly recommended that you download and read Picogrid Final Year Project.pdf as it will explain the purposes of this project and how it works.
